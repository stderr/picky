picky
=====

A little web app allowing people to predict fantasy football players performance.
Lot's of people like to talk smack during the off-season (including myself), and especially during [mocks](http://www.fantasyfootballcalculator.com/).
picky will allow you to make the predictions by season and by specific games, and bring some measure of accountability to bold statements (particularly mine).


### Setup
Add an initializer that sets the API key for the [fantasy_football_nerd](https://github.com/GregBaugues/fantasy_football_nerd) gem:

````ruby
  FFNerd.api_key = your_api_key 
````
